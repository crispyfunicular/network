però un dels mètodes més senzills i utilitzats és examinant el nombre de variables, també conegudes com a paràmetres, dins de la xarxa. Els paràmetres d'una xarxa neuronal inclouen pesos i biaixos, que s'ajusten durant el procés d'entrenament per minimitzar la funció de pèrdua. Entendre el nombre de paràmetres és important perquè afecta directament els requisits computacionals, l'ús de la memòria i la capacitat de la xarxa per generalitzar des de dades d'entrenament fins a dades no vistes.</p><p>Per calcular el nombre de paràmetres d'una xarxa neuronal, cal tenir en compte l'arquitectura de la xarxa, que inclou el nombre de capes, el tipus de capes (per exemple, completament connectades, convolucionals, recurrents) i el nombre de neurones o unitats en cada capa. Desglossem el procés per a diferents tipus de capes que s'utilitzen habitualment a les xarxes neuronals:</p><h4>Capes totalment connectades</h4><p>Una capa completament connectada (densa) és aquella on cada neurona de la capa està connectada amb totes les neurones de la capa anterior. El nombre de paràmetres d'una capa totalment connectada es pot calcular mitjançant la fórmula:</p><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 19px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno"> &nbsp; </span><span class="ql-left-eqno"> &nbsp; </span><img decoding="async" src="https://eitca.org/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d5f973774e7aa806940f53f25673f90d_l3.png" height="19" width="360" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" alt="\[ \text{Nombre de paràmetres} = (n_{\text{entrada}} + 1) \times n_{\text{sortida}} \]" title="Presentat per QuickLaTeX.com"></p><p>Aquí, <img decoding="async" src="https://eitca.org/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-67907a542566bd4086e18f1bc4bcea46_l3.png" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" alt="n_{\text{entrada}}" title="Presentat per QuickLaTeX.com" height="14" width="43" style="vertical-align: -6px;"> és el nombre d'unitats d'entrada (neurones) a la capa i <img decoding="async" src="https://eitca.org/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-cbe2f059cecc4c2eaa0a35516a5556c6_l3.png" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" alt="n_{\text{sortida}}" title="Presentat per QuickLaTeX.com" height="14" width="52" style="vertical-align: -6px;"> és el nombre d'unitats de sortida. El "+1" té en compte el terme de biaix associat a cada neurona de sortida.</p><p class="gt-block"><strong>Exemple:</strong><br> Penseu en una capa totalment connectada amb 128 unitats d'entrada i 64 unitats de sortida. El nombre de paràmetres seria:</p><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 19px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno"> &nbsp; </span><span class="ql-left-eqno"> &nbsp; </span><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://eitca.org/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-0925d0226931a7645b91c1860b803d11_l3.png" height="19" width="259" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" alt="\[ (128 + 1) \times 64 = 129 \times 64 = 8256 \]" title="Presentat per QuickLaTeX.com"></p><h4>Capes convolucionals</h4><p>Les capes convolucionals s'utilitzen principalment en tasques de processament d'imatges. Apliquen filtres convolucionals (nuclis) a les dades d'entrada per extreure característiques.

Per exemple, considereu una xarxa neuronal de feedforward simple amb l'arquitectura següent:</p><p class="gt-block">1. Capa d'entrada: 784 unitats (p. ex., per a imatges de 28 × 28 píxels)<br> 2.

GPT-3 és un model basat en transformadors, que té 175 mil milions de paràmetres sorprenents (és a dir, <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://eitca.org/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b928d0b2256bd6e1e05e7757a77ec1be_l3.png" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" alt="10 ^ 9" title="Presentat per QuickLaTeX.com" height="15" width="24" style="vertical-align: 0px;"> paràmetres). Aquesta escala de paràmetres permet al model realitzar una àmplia gamma de tasques de processament del llenguatge natural amb una gran precisió. L'arquitectura de GPT-3 inclou múltiples capes de transformador, cadascuna amb nombrosos capçals d'atenció i xarxes de feedforward, que contribueixen al gran nombre de paràmetres.</p><h4>Consideracions pràctiques</h4><p>Quan es treballa amb grans xarxes neuronals, s'han de tenir en compte diverses consideracions pràctiques:</p><p class="gt-block">1. <strong>Recursos computacionals:</strong> L'entrenament i el desplegament de models grans requereixen una potència computacional important, sovint necessitant l'ús de maquinari especialitzat com ara GPU o TPU.</p><p class="gt-block">2. <strong>Ús de la memòria:</strong> La memòria necessària per emmagatzemar i processar els paràmetres pot ser substancial. Sovint s'utilitzen tècniques eficients de gestió de memòria, com ara el paral·lelisme de models i el punt de control de gradient.</p><p class="gt-block">3. <strong>Temps d'entrenament:</strong> Els models més grans solen requerir temps d'entrenament més llargs. Tècniques com l'entrenament distribuït i l'entrenament de precisió mixta poden ajudar a mitigar aquest problema.</p><p class="gt-block">4. <strong>Sobreajustament:</strong> Amb un gran nombre de paràmetres, hi ha un risc d'ajustament excessiu, on el model funciona bé amb les dades d'entrenament però malament amb les dades no vistes. Per fer-ho, s'utilitzen tècniques de regularització com ara l'abandonament, la disminució del pes i l'augment de dades.</p><p class="gt-block">5. <strong>Latència d'inferència:</strong> El temps necessari per generar prediccions (inferència) pot ser més gran per a models més grans. Tècniques com la quantificació de models i la poda poden ajudar a reduir la latència d'inferència.</p><p>La complexitat d'una xarxa neuronal, mesurada pel nombre de paràmetres, és un aspecte fonamental que influeix en el seu rendiment, requisits computacionals i capacitat de generalització. Entendre com calcular i gestionar aquesta complexitat és important per dissenyar xarxes neuronals efectives. Amb els avenços en el maquinari i les tècniques d'optimització, ara és possible entrenar i desplegar models extremadament grans, com ara GPT-3, que han superat els límits del que és possible en intel·ligència artificial.</p><h4>Altres preguntes i respostes recents sobre <a
